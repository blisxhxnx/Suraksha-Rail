**Suraksha Rail**

Suraksha Rail is an AI-powered railway safety system that detects track obstacles and track defects in real time to prevent collisions and derailments.

**Problem**

1) Manual and periodic railway inspections

2) Late detection of obstacles and track faults

3) Increased risk in low-visibility conditions

4) Reactive safety mechanisms

**Solution**

1) Real-time obstacle detection using computer vision

2) Track fault detection using image-based AI models

3) Early alerts for proactive accident prevention

4) Centralized monitoring dashboard

**Tech Stack**

1) Frontend: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS

2) Backend: Python, FastAPI, Streamlit

3) AI Models: YOLO (v8/v11), CNN

4) Libraries: OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas

5) Visualization: Folium, CSV logs

**How It Works**

1) Live camera feed is processed frame-by-frame

2) AI detects obstacles and track defects

3) Risk level and distance are calculated

4) Real-time alerts are generated

5) Data is visualized on a central dashboard

**Key Features**

1) Real-time obstacle detection

2) Automated track fault detection

3) Early warning system

4) GPS-based hazard mapping

5) Reduced human dependency

**Impact**

1) Improves railway safety

2) Reduces accidents and derailments

3) Enables preventive maintenance

4) Supports data-driven decision-making

**Suraksha Rail uses AI to proactively detect railway hazards and prevent accidents before they happen.**
